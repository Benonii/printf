This project is an imitation of C's printf function done in a group by Benoni Esckinder and Selam Afework. It had two mandatory tasks

0.
"Write a function that produces output according to a format.

    Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
    Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
    write output to stdout, the standard output stream
    format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
        c
        s
        %
    You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
    You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    You don’t have to handle field width
    You don’t have to handle precision
    You don’t have to handle the length modifiers"

"Handle the following conversion specifiers:

    d
    i
    You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    You don’t have to handle field width
    You don’t have to handle precision
    You don’t have to handle the length modifiers"

(Description given from the alx-intranet)

The advanced tasks written here are: 
Q.3 Handling the '%u' following conversion specifier:

You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

Q.4 Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
